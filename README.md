# Flux Project

## About
Created by the Shorewood Hatch Club, which is advised by Mr. Bruno.

## Installation
In the command line, navigate to the desired folder and clone the git repository into it.
```
$ cd <desired folder>
$ git clone https://github.com/HatchSW/Flux.git
$ cd sasapp
```

## Running SAS App
Open the flux.xcodeproj in your xcode editor and hit the run button (black arrow) in the left corner.

## Pushing your changes
All changes can sent to the github from Xcode itself. No need for the command line :).

```
$ 1. In Xcode, click "source control"->"commit" from the menu bar.
$ 2. You will be presented with a window to approve all of your changes.
$ 3. Check the boxes for the files you want to send to the github. (only files you changed will show up)
$ 4. In the bottom left corner, check the box that says push to remote.
$ 5. Click the blue bottom "commit files and push".
$ 6. On the first push you will need to login to github.
$ 7. You may not get confirmation of success, but the files may be on the github. Just go check for your changes.
$ 8. If you get an error, try "source control"->"Pull" first and then retry these steps. This will make sure you are synced with the github files.
$ 9. If pulling from github first does not fix it. Post your issue on the github page under issues.
```
